# Algorithm Visualizer

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 
 

So far there are 6 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree


## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- A star
- Recursive Maze Creation
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- N Queen Backtracking
- Binary Search
- Recursion
- Fibonacci Number
- Binomial Coefficient

 Any kind of contributions are welcomes. Also if you like this please star this repo. It keeps me motivated.
